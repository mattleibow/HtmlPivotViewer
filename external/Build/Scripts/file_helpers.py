# file_helpers.py
# Utility methods for working with files and trees in Python and a source
# control environment, where e.g. files are typically marked read-only.
# 
# These methods can also be invoked from the command line, which is useful for
# pre- and post-build rules, since CMD lacks commands like copying a tree.
# 
# Command-line usage:
# python file_helpers.py {command} [{args...}]
# 
# Examples:
# python file_helpers.py copytree foo\bar foo\baz
# 
# Notes:
# All paths will be relative to the working directory.
# Currently, only copytree is available via the command line. :)
