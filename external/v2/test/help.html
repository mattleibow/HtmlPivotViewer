    <h1>Seajax v2 Unit Test Help Page</h1>
    <p>
    This here is only bare-bones information.  More to follow.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Test path is [suite-name]_[test-name]</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

        <p>
        Execution and reporting of unit tests is somewhat configurable via the test
        page url.  Configuration parameters are provided as url parameters.
        </p>

        <h3>filter</h3>
        <p>
        This setting is a regex expression that is matched against each test's path,
        which consists of its suite name followed by and underscore followed by the
        specific test's name.  For matches, the specific test is run; otherwise, the
        specific test is not run.  The default filter is empty.
        </p>

        <h3>priority</h3>
        Suites and or tests are assigned to a priority level.  The default level is
        zero.  Specifying this configuration setting allows running of tests with
        priority greater than zero.  For a specified priority level N here, all tests
        with assigned priority less than or equal to N are run.

        <h3>tags</h3>
        Tags provide another angle for selecting subsets of tests.  Suites and tests
        can be assigned a tag.  By selecting one or more tags in the configuration
        setting (separated by comma), only those tests that have one of these tags
        are run.

        <h3>reportTo</h3>
        By default, test results are displayed visually on the unit test page.  This
        setting allows for reporting the results to some service.  If provided, the
        value must be an absolute http url path.  The test results, in JSON format,
        will be POSTed to this url once all tests complete.

    <h2>Running Tests</h2>

        <p>
        Selected tests can be re-run simply by refreshing the page.
